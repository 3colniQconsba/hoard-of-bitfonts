NEC PC-9800 series
------------------

The `nec-pc98-*` files are taken from the character ROM of a NEC PC-9821 Ce2 model S2D.
There are two single-byte character sets and one kanji set. The single-byte sets follow
an [extension of JIS x 0201](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JIS_X_0201#/media/File:NEC-C-6220-paths.svg). The double-byte set is likely a form of Shift-JIS.

The single-byte sets have been mapped to standard JIS x0201; the PC-98 extension (shown on the Wikipedia link but not yet mapped to Unicode)
and the kanji encoding still need to be mapped.
