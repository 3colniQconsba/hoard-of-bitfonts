TRS-80 Model I, Model III, Model 4
==================================

These were taken from character ROMs. 

Model I
-------

The original TRS-80 was later referred to as the Model I.

The Model I set includes the lowercase letters (which were present but not accessible in early models) 
and has been enriched with the 2x3 semigraphic characters that were accessible in the range 0x80-0xBF.

This is the same as the MCM6674 character set, except for 0x5b-0x5e where arrow symbols have been substituted for the more standard ascii symbols in the MCM6674 set.

Many versions of the Model I character set existed, as it was common to upgrade or modify the TRS-80, 
for example to make the lowercase set accessible and to reposition its descenders. 


Model III and Model 4
---------------------

These models had the same character set. The set included here is the ROM order,
which excludes the 2x3 semigraphics. All glyphs in this set were accessible, with 0x80-0xBF mapped to semigraphics and 0xC0-0xFF mapped to either Kana or digbats, depending on a toggle. 

additionally, a variant character set from a Model 4P character ROM is included. 
This set excludes Kana and includes additional accented Latin characters.
