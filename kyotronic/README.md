A note on character mappings
----------------------------

The glyphs have been mapped to Unicode codepoints with the help of a Tandy-200 mapping created by `hackerb9`.
I have erred on the side of not providing a codepoint for glyphs where no obvious match was found. For the graphical glyphs in these sets, no documentation was found to determine the glyph designer's intentions as to their meaning.

If you have documentation about the meaning or contemporary use of these glyphs, please get in touch.
