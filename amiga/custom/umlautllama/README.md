UmlautLlama Amiga fonts
=======================

These custom Amiga fonts were extracted from .bdf files at http://umlautllama.com/projects/font/.

The original files had metadata issues where the boundingbox is set to values over 65536 for some glyphs.
I have corrected these, but I'm not sure if this faithfully reproduces the original glyphs' widths.
