The MC6847 fonts are extracted from the MAME source code. While the CoCo used Motorola MC6847 character generators, these fonts are different from the TRS-80 
fonts by David Keil. A 'modified' MC6847T1 was used in the CoCo3; the font displayed in the MC6847T1 datasheet is different again.

These fonts are extracted from the XRoar emulator source code.
