In this article, we will show you how to use tag comercio SERIAL to create dynamic web pages that display data from a temperature sensor and a barcode scanner. We will also explain how to configure the serial port settings and how to style the tag using CSS.
 
## What is tag comercio SERIAL?
 
Tag comercio SERIAL is a custom HTML tag that was developed by Comercio, a company that specializes in web development and serial communication. The tag allows you to insert data from a serial port into your web page using the following syntax:

    <tag-comercio-serial port="COM1" baudrate="9600" parity="none" stopbits="one" databits="8"></tag-comercio-serial>

The tag has several attributes that specify the serial port settings:
 
- port: the name of the serial port (e.g. COM1, COM2, etc.)
- baudrate: the speed of data transmission in bits per second (e.g. 9600, 19200, etc.)
- parity: the method of error detection (e.g. none, odd, even, etc.)
- stopbits: the number of bits used to indicate the end of a byte (e.g. one, two, etc.)
- databits: the number of bits used to represent a character (e.g. 8, 7, etc.)

The tag will automatically read data from the specified serial port and display it in your web page. You can use multiple tags with different ports and settings to display data from different sources.
 
## How to use tag comercio SERIAL to display data from a temperature sensor
 
In this example, we will use tag comercio SERIAL to display data from a temperature sensor connected to our computer via a serial cable. The temperature sensor sends data in the format of "T=xx.xC" where xx.x is the temperature in degrees Celsius.
 
To display the data from the temperature sensor, we will use the following HTML code:

    <html>
    <head>
    <title>Temperature Sensor</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    <h1>Temperature Sensor</h1>
    <p>The current temperature is:</p>
    <tag-comercio-serial port="COM1" baudrate="9600" parity="none" stopbits="one" databits="8"></tag-comercio-serial>
    </body>
    </html>

This code will create a web page that looks like this:

The tag comercio SERIAL will display the data from the temperature sensor in real-time. If the temperature changes, the web page will update automatically.
 
## How to use tag comercio SERIAL to display data from a barcode scanner
 
In this example, we will use tag comercio SERIAL to display data from a barcode scanner connected to our computer via a serial cable. The barcode scanner sends data in the format of "B=xxxxxxxxxx" where xxxxxxxxxx is the barcode number.
 
To display the data from the barcode scanner, we will use the following HTML code:

    <html>
    <head>
    <title>Barcode Scanner</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    <h1>Barcode Scanner</h1>
    <p>The scanned barcode is:</p>
    <tag-comercio-serial port="COM2" baudrate="9600" parity="none" stopbits="one" databits="8"></tag-comercio-serial>
    </body>
