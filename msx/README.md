==================

These character sets were extracted from various MSX ROM dumps. The character mappings are based on those distributed with Unicode 
proposal L2/21-235 [Proposal to add further characters from legacy computers and teletext to the UCS](https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2021/21235-terminals-supplement.pdf)
